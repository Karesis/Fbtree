## Installation

### Using pip

```bash
pip install fbtree
```

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fbtree.git
cd fbtree
pip install -e .
```

## Basic Usage

```python
from fbtree import create_tree, Move

# Create a tree
tree = create_tree()

# Start building a path
tree.start_path()

# Add moves to the path
tree.add_move(Move("A1"))
tree.add_move(Move("B2"))
tree.add_move(Move("C3"))

# Record the outcome
tree.record_outcome("win")

# Get statistics
stats = tree.get_statistics()
print(stats)
```

## Analysis Features

```python
from fbtree import create_tree, Move, analyze_path_frequency, find_winning_paths, calculate_move_impact

# Create and populate a decision tree
tree = create_tree()
# ... add some paths and results ...

# Analyze move frequency at different depths
freq_data = analyze_path_frequency(tree.get_all_fibers())
print("Move frequency analysis:", freq_data)

# Find high win-rate paths
winning_paths = find_winning_paths(tree.get_all_fibers(), min_visits=5, min_win_rate=0.6)
print("High win-rate paths:", winning_paths)

# Calculate the impact of each move on win rates
impact_data = calculate_move_impact(tree.get_all_fibers())
print("Move impact analysis:", impact_data)
```

## Visualization Features

```python
from fbtree import create_tree, Move, visualize_tree_text, generate_path_summary
from fbtree import generate_graphviz, generate_d3_json

# Create and populate a decision tree
tree = create_tree()
# ... add some paths and results ...

# Text visualization
text_tree = visualize_tree_text(tree.get_all_fibers())
print(text_tree)

# Path summary
path_summary = generate_path_summary(tree.get_all_fibers(), min_visits=3)
print(path_summary)

# Graphviz visualization
dot_graph = generate_graphviz(tree.get_all_fibers(), max_depth=3, theme='light')
with open('tree_visualization.dot', 'w') as f:
    f.write(dot_graph)
    
# D3.js data generation
d3_data = generate_d3_json(tree.get_all_fibers())
with open('tree_data.json', 'w') as f:
    f.write(d3_data)
```

## Core Concepts

- **Fiber** - Represents a complete decision path, composed of a series of Moves
- **Move** - A single step or decision in the decision path
- **Tree** - Collection of all related decision paths
- **Storage** - Responsible for persistent storage of decision path data
